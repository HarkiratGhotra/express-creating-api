use nodemon to run the command, install Joi to validate the schema made for api and use express to make the api 

npm init --yes
npm i express
node index.js  ( index.js -> is the file where we write get , post, put ) 

if someone wants to continously run the node 
then use 
nodemon index.js


JOI 
npm i joi 
this is for validations, if we want customaize validation then we can use JOI
